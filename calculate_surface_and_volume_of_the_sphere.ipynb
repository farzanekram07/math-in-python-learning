    "Consider a sphere of radius r. We can slice this sphere into many horizontal rings, each with a width of Δr. The circumference of each ring is 2πr, and its area is approximately equal to the area of a flat disk with radius r times the width of the ring (2πr Δr). Summing up the areas of all these rings using calculus, we get the formula A = ∫(0 to r) 2πr Δr = 4πr^2."

    "We start by considering a sphere of radius r, with equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2. We want to find the surface area of this sphere. We can think of the sphere as being made up of many small, flat surfaces, each of which is a tangent plane to the sphere at a point on its surface. We can express the equation of such a tangent plane as z = f(x, y) = ±√(r^2 - x^2 - y^2) depending on which side of the sphere we are considering. The area of this small tangent plane is then given by the formula A = ∫∫dS = ∫∫ √(1 + (∂f/∂x)^2 + (∂f/∂y)^2) dxdy.\n",

    "Substituting f(x, y) into this expression and simplifying, we obtain A = ∫∫ 2πr cos(θ) dxdy, where θ is the angle between the z-axis and the normal vector to the tangent plane at a given point (x, y). Integrating over the region of the sphere using polar coordinates, we get A = 4πr^2."
